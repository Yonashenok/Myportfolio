            As an Electromechanical Engineer with a passion for technology and
            innovation, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of

            principles and a hands-on approach to problem-solving, I have
            successfully transitioned into the dynamic world of full stack
            development, where I continue to leverage my analytical skills and
            attention to detail to build robust, user-centric solutions.
